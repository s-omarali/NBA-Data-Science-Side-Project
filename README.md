# NBA-Data-Science-Side-Project
Summer side project using the NBA API to practice my data science skills in a field i have a lot of interest in - Sports and specifically basketball.  

## What is the goal of this side project?  
When deciding on a topic to use this NBA api for, I had quite a few options. The options were:    
- Prediciting NBA MVPs  
- Predicting Playoff Winners  
- NBA Game Simulation  
- The benefit of home court advantage  

## Which one did I decide on?  
After much contemplation, I decided on predicting playoff winners. The reasons I picked this topic over the others was that it would be pretty challenging compared to something like homecourt advantage and would force me to polish my machine learning skills. I also feel as if prediciting playoff wins is a lot more statistically backed compared to MVP voting that hasn't been consistent throughout the years.  

## What parameters should be measured to determine a winning team?
- Offensive and defensive rating  
- Regular season record  
- Second half of season record  
- Player's past playoff experience (rotation players)  
- Average age of players
